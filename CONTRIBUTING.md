Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Animate.css**! Before contributing, please make sure you understand the guidelines provided here. **Animate.css** is widely used, so it’s important to maintain a high level of quality and to contribute with the interests of the community in mind.

## Design Guidelines

Animations, like many facets of visual and interaction design, can be highly subjective. Maintaining a consistent library of animations in an active community can be difficult; these design guidelines are designed to help encourage thoughtful criticism of new animations that are proposed for **Animate.css**.

The animations in **Animate.css** should follow a few key principles:
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should be subtle.</b> Avoid creating animations that involve large translations, or span a natural duration of longer than 1 second.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should be tolerable.</b> Related to subtlety, animations should be tolerable—seeing them repeatedly should not become too annoying or overbearing.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should not interfere with document flow or control/input availability.</b> In other words, the absence of an animation should never reduce usability of a product: they should be non-critical and seen as "progressive enhancements". Avoid animations that change properties such as <i>position</i> or <i>display</i>.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should be helpful.</b> They should be designed to guide users to a point of interest, ease natural reading order, or to communicate relationships between elements.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should feel familiar.</b> Avoid introducing animations that feel out-of-place compared to the existing set.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">✅ <b>Animations should feel natural.</b> Animations should reflect, as much as is reasonable, motion that occurs in natural physics. Avoid extreme timing functions, and model animations on real-world events.</li>
</ul>

## Code Styling

1. Match the naming convention (camelCase, categorized [fades, bounces, etc]).
2. Indent with two spaces.
3. End each file with a blank line.
4. Make sure you have an editorconfig plugin/extension enabled in your editor and all the dependencies installed so editorconfig and prettier can automatically format your code when committing.
